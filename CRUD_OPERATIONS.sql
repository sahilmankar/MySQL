/*  NOT EXISTS check is the table is alrady present in database or not, if present it will return false otherwise it create table
The task_id is an auto-increment column. If you use the INSERT statement to insert a new row into the table without specifying a value for the task_id column,
MySQL will automatically generate a sequential integer for the task_id starting from 1.
The title column is a variable character string column whose maximum length is 25. It means that you cannot insert a string whose length is greater than 25 into this column. 
The NOT NULL constraint indicates that the column does not accept NULL. In other words, you have to provide a non-NULL value when you insert or update this column.
The start_date and due_date are DATE columns. Because these columns do not have the NOT NULL constraint, they can store NULL.
The start_date column has a default value of the current date. In other words, if you donâ€™t provide a value for the start_date column when you insert a new row,
the start_date column will take the current date of the database server.
The status and priority are the TINYINT columns which do not allow NULL.
The description column is a TEXT column that accepts NULL.
The created_at is a TIMESTAMP column that accepts the current time as the default value.
The task_id is the primary key column of the tasks table. It means that the values in the task_id column will uniquely identify rows in the table. */
